# 🐍 Python Mini Projects (OOP-Based)

This repository contains Python mini projects focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, such as:

- ✅ **Abstract Base Classes (ABC)**
- ✅ **Inheritance**
- ✅ **Polymorphism**
- ✅ **Method Overriding**

Each project is beginner-friendly yet powerful enough to demonstrate real-world OOP applications.

## 🔧 How to Run

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Shank312/D-Day-05-Python-Mini-Projects-OOP-Based.git

# Navigate into the folder
cd D-Day-05-Python-Mini-Projects-OOP-Based
🚗 Project 1: Vehicle Class (ABC)
Objective: Use Abstract Base Class to define a general Vehicle, then extend it with Car and Bike subclasses.

Highlights:

Abstract methods: start_engine(), stop_engine()

Subclass behavior override for engine starting mechanisms (key vs kick)

🏦 Project 2: Bank System (Inheritance)
Objective: Create a basic bank system using inheritance:

Base class: Account

Subclasses: SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount

Functions: Deposit, Withdraw, Balance

🎓 Project 3: Grade Evaluation (Polymorphism)
Objective: Evaluate student grades using method overriding across subjects:

Base class: Student

Subclasses: MathStudent, ScienceStudent

Overridden method: evaluate_grade()
